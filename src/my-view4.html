        <p>Sharing information with the colleagues can be time consuming. Updates, changes etc make the process messy and increase the likelihood of errors. Using deko keeps things simple, speeds up productivity and keeps you on track.</p>
        <p>Create, organise and share curated content onto cards, sort them into decks before sharing them with the relevant parties, whether it’s everyone, a department, a team or a project.</p>
        <p>Administrators have control of the cards and decks, but can give over as many or as few permissions as they want to other users, when it comes to creation, editing, deleting or sharing. The choices are entirely with your organisation.</p>
        <p>deko also has a dashboard which generates real time analytics allowing administrators to see what’s happening, when it's happening and make any alterations they want based on this information.</p>
