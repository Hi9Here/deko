        <p>deko’s part of Hi9 - a company that offers a suite of services that make technologies and the web simple. Hi9 matches up customers with a range of affordable, easy to use, secure hardware solutions.</p>
        <p>An example the chromebook, a browser only laptop with inbuilt security, no need for updates and multi functional ability.</p>  
        <p>Hi9 is continually reviewing the very latest in tech for its suitability; most recently - Amazon's Alexa and Google's Home. Both these voice activated products are ideal for first time users that only need to access basic functions.</p>
        <p>deko can be incorporated into every bit of tech to complete the package, mirroring Hi9’s philosophy for simplicity.</p>
        <p>Hi9 and deko share the same - if it’s simple people will use it.</p>
