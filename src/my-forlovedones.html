        <p>When you don’t have any spare time or don’t live close by to a loved one, being their tech support’s hard work. It’s not long before good intentions turn into frustrations. It’s different with deko - because it makes the web simple.</p>
        <p>Deko lets you create and curate content. That means there’s no search or background noise to confuse a loved one plus it reduces the risks of online fraud which is peace of mind for you.</p>
        <p>All you do is create a small selection of cards containing weblinks to useful, safe sites. Each card clearly displays a recognisable picture or icon along with a title, so with just one click your loved one will be exactly where they should be.</p>
