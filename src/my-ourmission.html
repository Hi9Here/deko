        <p>deko’s part of Hi9 - a company offering a suite of services that make technologies and the web simple. Hi9 matches up customers with a range of affordable, easy to use, secure hardware solutions.</p>
        <p>An example of that is the chromebook, a browser only laptop with inbuilt security, no need for updates and with multi functional ability.</p>  
        <p>Hi9 is continually reviewing the very latest in tech for its suitability; most recently - Amazon's Alexa and Google's Home. Both these voice activated products are ideal for first time users that only need to access basic functions.</p>
        <p>deko can be incorporated into every piece of tech Hi9 offers, and mirrors its philosophy of simplicity.</p>
        <p>Hi9 and deko share the same mantra - if it’s simple people will use it.</p>
        <p>For more information about these and more services visit Hi9</p>
