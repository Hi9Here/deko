        <p>When you don’t have any spare time or don’t live close by to a loved one, being their tech support’s hard work. It’s not long before good intentions are buried in frustrations. It’s different with deko - because it makes the web simple.</p>
        <p>Deko lets you create and curate content. That means there’s no confusing search and background noise plus it reduces the risks of online fraud; and that’s peace of mind.</p>
        <p>All you do is create a small selection of cards containing weblinks to useful and suitable sites. Each card clearly displays a recognisable picture or icon along with a title, so with just one click your loved will go safely to where they should be.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for suggestions when it comes to the most suitable, simple to use hardware, visit our sister company Hi9.</p>
